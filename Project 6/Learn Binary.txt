Goals:
1. Learn the base two number system (binary) using 3 buttons and 7 LEDs


Materials: 

 - 7 LEDs
 - Wires
 - 3 Push buttons
 - 220 ohm resistor
 - 3 10 Kohm resistor
 - Arduino
 - USB Cable
 - Breadboard

How Binary Works:
 				    fours place     twos place       ones place
					1		1                 1
					4	+	2	+         1 = 7

Binary is a a base two number system, just 0 and 1. This means when you would ordinarly use a 2, you will instead add a new digit. Below is every number from 0 to 7 in decimal and binary.

0 - 000
1 - 001
2 - 010
3 - 011
4 - 100
5 - 101
6 - 110
7 - 111
